Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in
recent years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los
Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on his educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified
has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced
courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student ’ s academic grade.
This rule is meant to address the difficultythat students from impoverished or chaotic homes
might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly,
no homework should be assigned that studentscannot do without expensive equipment. But if the
district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of
complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be
lowered for poor children.
District administrators say that homework will still be a pat of schooling: teachers are
allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10%
of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see very little difference on their
report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but
what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite
possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best
for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.
At the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. If
the district finds homework to be unimportant to itsstudents ’ academic achievement, it should
move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely,
ifhomework does nothing to ensure that the homework students are not assigning more than they
are willing to review and correct.
The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, whichis responsible for
setting educational policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for
L.A. Unified to do homework right.

Pretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is
pervasive in our young girls ’ lives. It is not that pink intrinsically bad, but it is a tiny sliceof the
rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fused
girls ’ identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between
girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, despaired at the singular
lack of imagination about girls ’ lives and interests.
Girls' attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but
according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor ofAmerican Studies, it's not. Children were not
colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domesticwashing machines all
babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil
them. What's more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses.
When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a
pastel version ofred, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin
Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when
amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children's marketing strategy, thatpink
fully came into its own, when it began to seem innately attractive to girls, part of what defined
them as female, at least for the first few critical years.
I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural
to kids, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I
assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children's
behaviour: wrong. Turns out, according to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it
was popularised as a marketing gimmick by clothing manufacturers in the 1930s.
Trade publications counseled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should
create a "third stepping stone" between infant wear and older kids' clothes. It was only after
"toddler" became common shoppers' term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental
stage. Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost
profits.And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences – or
invent them where they did not previously exist.
26. By saying "it is ... The rainbow"(line 3, Para 1), the author means pink _______.
A should not be the sole representation of girlhood
B should not be associated with girls' innocence
C cannot explain girls' lack of imagination
D cannot influence girls' lives and interests
27.According to Paragraph 2, which of the following is true of colours?
A Colors are encoded in girls' DNA
B Blue used to be regarded as the color for girls
C Pink used to be a neutral color in symbolizing genders
D White is preferred by babies
28. The author suggests that our perception of children's psychological devotementwas much
influenced by ________.
[A] the marketing of products for children
[B] the observation of children's nature
[C] researches into children's behavior
[D] studies of childhood consumption
29. We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised ________.
A focuses on infant wear and older kids'clothes
B attach equal importance to different genders
C classify consumers into smaller groups
D create some commonshoppers' terms
30. It can be concluded that girl's attraction to pink seems to be _____.
A clearly explained by their inborn tendency
B fully understood by clothing manufacturers
C mainly imposed by profit-driven businessmen
D well interpreted by psychological experts

In 2010. a federal judge shookAmerica's biotech industry to its core. Companies had won
patents for isolated DNAfor decades-by 2005 some 20% of human genes were parented. But in
March2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The
Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a
“preliminary step” in a longer battle.
On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the
prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help
forecast a woman's risk of breast cancer. The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said
the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.
But as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine, thecourts will remain
rather busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments
against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents
suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests
such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for
patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department ofJustice filed a brief in the Myriad
case, arguing that an isolated DNAmolecule “is no less a product of nature... than are cotton fibres
that have been separated from cotton seeds.”
Despite the appeals court's decision, big questionsremain unanswered. For example, it is
unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within
it. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.
AS the industry advances, however, other suits may have aneven greater impact. Companies
are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules - most are already patented or in
the public domain .firms are now studying how genesinteract, looking for correlations that might
be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug ’ s efficacy. Companies are eager to win
patents for ‘connecting the dots’, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer forthe BIO.
Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic,
which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term. The BIO recently helda convention which
included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was
packed.
31. It can be learned from paragraph I that the biotech companies would like______
A. their executives to be active
B. judges to ruleout gene patenting
C. genes to be patentable
D. the BIO to issue a warning
32. Those who are against gene patents believe that_____
A. genetic tests are not reliable
B. only man-made products are patentable
C. patents on genes depend much on innovations
D. courts should restrict access to genetic tests
33.According to Hans Sauer, companies are eager to win patents for_____
A. establishing disease compellations
B. discovering gene interactions
C. drawing pictures of genes
D. identifying human DNA
34．By saying “each meeting was packed”(line4,para6)the author means that_____
A. the Supreme Court was authoritative
B. the BIO was a powerful organization
C. gene patenting was a great concern
D. lawyers were keen to attend conventions
35. Generally speaking, the author ’ s attitude toward gene patenting is_____
A. critical
B. supportive
C. scornful
D. objective

The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning.
Before it ends,
Itwill likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults.And
ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics, our culture, and the character of our society for
years.
No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster.
Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they
had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were moreaware of the struggles
of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off.At the very least,
it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a
necessary end toan era of reckless personalspending.
But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral
Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both
inside and outside the U.S. , lengthy periods of economic stagnation or declinehave almost always
left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the
advance of rights and freedoms.Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict
between races and classes.
Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one. Indeed,
this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross
them--- especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia
University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed:
those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would
have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.
In the internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden
withinAmerican society. More difficult, in the moment, is discerning precisely how these lean
times are affecting society ’ s character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant
entering this recession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social
conflict since then haveshown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard
times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly it, and all the more so the longer they
extend.

to___.

“Universal history, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the
History of the Great Men who have workedhere,” wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Well,
not any more it is not.
Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no more
than a passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truthabout how we now approach the
past: less concerned with learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. Today,
we want empathy, not inspiration.
From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writingof history meant recounting the exemplary
lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus - On
Famous Men, highlighting the virtus （or virtue） of classical heroes. Petrarch celebrated their
greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical tradition which
Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. InThe Prince,the championed cunning, ruthlessness, and
boldness,rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.
Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters
and authors of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist's personalexperience rather than
public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self-Help asa catalogue of
the worthy lives of engineers , industrialists and explores . "The valuable examples which they
furnish of the power of self-help, if patient purpose, resolute working and steadfast integrity,
issuing in the formulation of truly noble and many character, exhibit,"wrote Smiles."what it is in
the power of each to accomplish for himself"His biographies of James Walt, RichardArkwright
and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.
This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic
lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures
representedlives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere
morals.
Communist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged
battles:“It is man, real, living man who does all that.”And history should be the story of the
masses and theirrecord of struggle.As such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the
social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood. For:“Men make their own history,
but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by
themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past.”
This was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas
Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EPThompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from
below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole new realms of understanding - from
gender to race to cultural studies - were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost
societies.And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating asupstairs.
[A] emphasized the virtueof
classical heroes.

Section II Reading Comprehension

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs ’ s board as an outside director in January 2000: a year
later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently
managed both roles without attracting much eroticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was
under fire for having sat on Goldman ’ s compensation committee; how could she have let those
enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the
board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.
Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm ’ s board.
Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere,they presumably have enough
independence to disagree with the chief executive ’ s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is
falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own
crises.
The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms
and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked
which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing
a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directors
under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company
will subsequently have to restate earnings increasedby nearly 20%. The likelihood of being
named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse.
The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and
subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are
always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they “trade up.” Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger
and more stable firms.
But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding ablow to
their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows
they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside
directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will
followthe example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.
21.According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized for .
[A]gaining excessive profits
[B]failing to fulfill her duty
[C]refusingto make compromises
[D]leaving the board in tough times
22. We learn from Paragraph 2 that outside directors are supposed to be .
[A]generous investors
[B]unbiased executives
[C]share price forecasters
[D]independent advisers
23. According to the researchers from Ohio University after an outside director ’ s surprise
departure, the firmis likely to .
[A]become more stable
[B]report increased earnings
[C]do less well in the stock market
[D]performworse in lawsuits
24. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside directors .
[A]may stay for the attractive offers from the firm
[B]have often had records of wrongdoings in thefirm
[C]are accustomed to stress-free work in the firm
[D]will decline incentives from the firm
25. The author ’ s attitude toward the role ofoutside directors is .

[B]positive
[C]scornful
[D]critical

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemednear. The
recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet.
Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America ’ s
Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers. Should they
become charitable corporations? Shouldthe state subsidize them ? It will hold another meeting
soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.
In much of the world there is the sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged
off the recession. Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled come of the global
industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were
routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.
It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The
American Society of NewsEditors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since2007.
Readers are payingmore for slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery
to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many
journalists, they can be pushed further.
Newspapers are becomingmore balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from
readers and advertisers. American papers have longbeen highly unusual in their reliance on ads.
Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly,
Japanese newspapers are much more stable.
The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage
has been concentrated in areas where newspaper are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have
gone. So have science and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off.
Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper
business.
26. By saying “Newspapers like … their own doom” (Lines 3-4, Para. 1), the author indicates
that newspaper .
[A]neglected the signof crisis
[B]failed to get state subsidies
[C]were not charitable corporations
[D]were in a desperate situation
27. Some newspapers refused delivery to distant suburbs probably because .
[A]readers threatened to pay less
[B]newspapers wanted to reduce costs
[C]journalists reported little about these areas
[D]subscribers complained about slimmer products
28. Compared with their American counterparts, Japanese newspapers are much more stable
because they .
[A]have more sources of revenue
[B]have more balanced newsrooms
[C]are less dependent on advertising
[D]areless affected by readership
29. What can be inferred from the last paragraph about the current newspaper business?
[A]Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers.
[B]Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper.
[C]Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business.
[D]Readershave lost their interest in car and film reviews.
30. The most appropriate title for this text would be .

[D]American Newspapers: A Hopeless Story

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity
and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going offto college on the G. I. Bill and
lining up at the marriage bureaus.
But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could
truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and
that restraint, incombination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient
housing positively stylish.
Economic condition wasonly a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase
“less ismore” was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe, wholike other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the
United States before World War II
and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous
influence on the course ofAmerican architecture, but none more so that Mies.
Mies ’ s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that
a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he
employed metal, glass and laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the
1940s symbolized thefuture. Mies ’ s sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he
designed were small and efficient, rather than bigand oftenempty.
The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago ’ s Lake Shore Drive, for example,
were smaller-two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet-than those in their older neighbors along
the city ’ s Gold Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they
afforded and the elegance of the buildings ’ details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of
the abstract art so popular at the time.
The trend toward “less” was notentirely foreign. In the 1930s FrankLloyd Wright started
building more modest and efficient houses-usually around 1,200 square feet-than the spreading
two-story ones he had designedin the 1890s and the early 20th century.
The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts
& Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the
“less is more” trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright
detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph everydaylife – few American families acquired
helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers – but his belief that self-sufficiency was
both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.

Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago.
Now even the project ’ s greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a “Bermuda triangle” of
debt, population decline and lower growth.
As well as those chronic problems, the EU face an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16
countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone ’ s economies,
weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency,
which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation.
Yet the debate about how to save Europe ’ s single currency from disintegration isstuck. It is
stuck because the euro zone ’ s dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for
greater harmonization within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonies.
Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrowspending and
competitiveness, barked by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These
might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the
suspension of a country ’ s voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic
co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small
majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a
small majority favour French interference.
A “southern” camp headed by French wants something different: ”European economic
government” within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians
intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via
cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers.
Finally, figures close to the France government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree
to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates orlabour
costs.
It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world ’ s largesttrading block. At its best, the
European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries,
its internal borders arefar more open to goods, capital and labour thanany comparabletrading
area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism
benign.

Who wouldhave thought that, globally, the IT industry produces about the samevolumes of
greenhouse gases as the world ’ s airlines do-rough 2 percent of all CO2 emissions?
Many everyday tasks takea surprising toll on the environment. A Google search can leak
between 0.2 and 7.0 grams of CO2 depending on how many attempts are needed to get the “right”
answer. To deliver results to its users quickly,then, Google has to maintain vast data centres round
the world, packed with powerful computers. Whileproducing large quantities of CO2, these
computers emit a great deal of heat, so the centres need to be well air-conditioned, which uses
even more energy.
However, Google and other big tech providers monitor their efficiency closely and make
improvements. Monitoring is the first step on the road to reduction, but there is much to be done,
and not just by big companies."""
